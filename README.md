# MolgraphX

A symmetry-sensitive method for interpreting the results of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs), which aims to explain the importance of individual atoms or fragments in a molecule for the GCNN predictions, while preserving molecular symmetry. This method provides a balance between formal accuracy and general chemical knowledge within a reasonable computational time.

## Installation

The package will be released to PyPI (pypi.org) soon:
```shell
pip install molgraphx
```
The package can be install from source using pip, for this you need to clone this repository, activate environment you want to add MolgraphX package to and install it using pip from MolgraphX directory
```shell
pip install .
```
All necessary packages listed in setup.py
