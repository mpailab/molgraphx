# MolgraphX

A symmetry-sensitive method for interpreting the results of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs), which aims to explain the importance of individual atoms or fragments in a molecule for the GCNN predictions, while preserving molecular symmetry. This method provides a balance between formal accuracy and general chemical knowledge within a reasonable computational time.

## Installation

The package can be installed from pypi.org:

```shell
pip install molgraphx
```
